# Prologue-Website
UWRF's literary magazine the Prologue deserves it's own webpage to take submissions and publish student work.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>

The Prologue doesn't have it's own website for taking submissions. The current system is all email based
and tracked by hand. Most literary magazines both have their own webpage to publish digital versions of
each edition and an online submission system, either their own of something like Sumbittable. My goal
is to give them their own website to publish digitally and to handle submissions in a more robust way.

<b>CURRENT PROGRESS</b>

3/3

It looks like a website! Huzzah! The frontend is essentially done, I feel comfortable making things with React, and I know where it's going next (which Mr. Hemingway says is the most important part of creating, pausing before you run out of ideas to recharge). There is not garbage CSS so it even looks ok! CSS and I are Enemies. Lots of copy pastaing from solutions found elsewhere to get it to Behave. One thing that deserves specific credit it this wonderful color palette from https://kdesign.co/blog/pastel-color-palette-examples/ who's color palette is used to color code the submissions on the inside part, I have used palette 16.

In summary, I've got the outside part which allows anyone to view the rules and upload their art, a short blurb about the Prologue, and a place where eventually there may be some old editions (we're discussing how long the stories can remain and things like copyright since the understanding used to be that it would go into print just once and then be done). 

On the inside part there's a dashboard that shows submissions color coded by genre and has a sort function and then lets you click into one submission to view details and add to the review history and update status. 

Well writing it out like that makes it feel like not that much, but I worked hard on it. As a one student show and as someone who works full time as well, trying to keep some kind of schedule and crame in bits and pieces before work or after a full day of classes felt a little insurmountable. But very literally bit by bit it came together and I'm happy with my progress. 

Another credit I would like to specfically credit is this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8. I watched it maybe three times completely and then kept going back to reference it often. In effect, my website is a fancy to do list, so. I also watched quite a few videos on state because it took me literally two weeks to really figure out and I quite frankly only understand it enough to make it work and figure out bugs. Working with it more will only add to my understanding and comfort with it. 

Moving forward is the backend stuff, which I feel relatively okay about already. It's mostly taking and storing the original submission, then having the edit history, and finally storing and serving the previous editions. 

I bring you another of god's ugliest links https://uwrf-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/branwyn_walker_my_uwrf_edu/EV-U4CKUca5AlVafKtRfh8sBChmtfUZaScW6yEwiM2i87g?e=ae48gk&nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJTdHJlYW1XZWJBcHAiLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJTaGFyZURpYWxvZy1MaW5rIiwicmVmZXJyYWxBcHBQbGF0Zm9ybSI6IldlYiIsInJlZmVycmFsTW9kZSI6InZpZXcifX0%3D but you know what? god loves ugly.

<b>OLD UPDATES</b> 

2/2

I've been chatting with the clubs officers Isabelle and Finley, after being connected by Dr. Rein, the mag's advisor 
and Creative Writing professor, about if that was something they would even want. Which they do. Hooray!
We're now chatting, trying to list out the requirements for what they want the page to do, not to do, the 
things they like about the system now, the things they don't like about the current system, and anything 
else they might think of as a fun little addition. 
Progress is a little slow since so many other people are being consulted about the requirements. Isabelle 
and Finley are also talking to the rest of the editing staff and getting their opinions about ideas.

Also, been trying to push my form example here for like an hour and keep getting denied to our shared repo, so I've posted it to my personal page https://github.com/IsaiahVirus/basicForm right there. It's even there twice since I was trying to figure out if it was broke-broke or just broke to our org page.
