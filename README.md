# Prologue-Website
UWRF's literary magazine the Prologue deserves it's own webpage to take submissions and publish student work

DESCRIPTION
The Prologue doesn't have it's own website for taking submissions. The current system is all email based
and tracked by hand. Most literary magazines both have their own webpage to publish digital versions of
each edition and an online submission system, either their own of something like Sumbittable. My goal
is to give them their own website to publish digitally and to handle submissions in a more robust way.

CURRENT PROGRESS
2/2
I've been chatting with the clubs officers Isabelle and Finley, after being connected by Dr. Rein, the mag's advisor 
and Creative Writing professor, about if that was something they would even want. Which they do. Hooray!
We're now chatting, trying to list out the requirements for what they want the page to do, not to do, the 
things they like about the system now, the things they don't like about the current system, and anything 
else they might think of as a fun little addition. 
Progress is a little slow since so many other people are being consulted about the requirements. Isabelle 
and Finley are also talking to the rest of the editing staff and getting their opinions about ideas.

Also, been trying to push my form example here for like an hour and keep getting denied to our shared repo, so I've posted it to my personal page https://github.com/IsaiahVirus/basicForm right there. It's even there twice since I was trying to figure out if it was broke-broke or just broke to our org page
